    description: |
      Collect operating system and environment metadata using Atomic Red Team
      tests that emulate adversary reconnaissance on Linux hosts. These
      executions provide realistic telemetry for validating detections around
      OS fingerprinting and environment discovery.
    supported_platforms: [linux]
    detection:
      - Monitor chained invocations of `uname`, `lsb_release`, `/etc/os-release`,
        and other host fingerprinting commands executed by untrusted users.
      - Alert when environment variables are enumerated outside administrative
        maintenance windows.

    description: |
      Execute a lightweight network-discovery scenario that captures the
      behaviour of adversaries enumerating listening sockets and active
      connections on Linux systems.
    supported_platforms: [linux]
    detection:
      - Baseline legitimate `netstat`, `ss`, or `lsof` usage and alert when
        enumeration utilities are executed by unusual accounts or at odd hours.
    tests:
      - number: 4
