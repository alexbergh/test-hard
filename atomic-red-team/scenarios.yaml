      Collect operating system and environment metadata using Atomic Red Team
      tests that emulate adversary reconnaissance on Linux hosts. These
      executions provide realistic telemetry for validating detections around
      OS fingerprinting and environment discovery.
    supported_platforms: [linux]
    detection:
      - Monitor chained invocations of `uname`, `lsb_release`, `/etc/os-release`,
        and other host fingerprinting commands executed by untrusted users.
      - Alert when environment variables are enumerated outside administrative
        maintenance windows.

      Execute a lightweight network-discovery scenario that captures the
      behaviour of adversaries enumerating listening sockets and active
      connections on Linux systems.
    supported_platforms: [linux]
    detection:
      - Baseline legitimate `netstat`, `ss`, or `lsof` usage and alert when
        enumeration utilities are executed by unusual accounts or at odd hours.

    technique: T1119
    technique_name: "Automated Collection"
    description: |
      Demonstrate native collection behaviours by staging data with Command
      Prompt and PowerShell. The scenario produces telemetry suitable for tuning
      detections around bulk data staging prior to exfiltration.
    supported_platforms: [windows]
    detection:
      - Watch for invocations of archive utilities (zip, tar) from temporary
        directories combined with wildcard collection patterns.
      - Inspect PowerShell transcript logs for scripted staging of user profiles
        or document folders.
    tests:

      - number: 2
