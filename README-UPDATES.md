## 📦 New Features

### 1. CI/CD Automation

```bash
# Automatic on every push:
✓ Code quality checks (lint, format)
✓ Unit tests with coverage
✓ Integration tests
✓ Security scanning (Trivy)
✓ Docker image builds
✓ Automated deployments
```

**Workflows**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Continuous Integration
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml` - Continuous Deployment
- `.github/workflows/dependency-update.yml` - Weekly updates

### 2. Testing Framework

**Unit Tests** (15+ tests):
```bash
make test-unit          # Run unit tests
make coverage           # With coverage report
```

**Integration Tests** (10+ tests):
```bash
make test-integration   # Full stack testing
```

**Test Coverage**: Target 80%

### 3. Multi-Environment Deployment

```bash
# Development (with debug tools)
make up-dev
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Staging (pre-production)
make up-staging

# Production (hardened)
make up-prod
```

Each environment has:
- Custom resource limits
- Security configurations
- Environment-specific settings

### 4. Kubernetes Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
make k8s-dev              # Development cluster
make k8s-staging          # Staging cluster
make k8s-prod             # Production cluster

# Or directly with kubectl
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/dev/
```

**Features**:
- Resource requests/limits
- PersistentVolumeClaims
- Security contexts
- Health checks
- Ingress with TLS
- Kustomize overlays

### 5. Version Management

```bash
# Bump version
make bump-patch    # 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
make bump-minor    # 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
make bump-major    # 1.0.0 → 2.0.0

# Check version
make version       # Show current version
```

Versions automatically:
- Tag Docker images
- Create Git tags
- Trigger deployments

### 6. Enhanced Developer Experience

**New Makefile Commands**:
```bash
# Setup
make install-dev         # Install dependencies + pre-commit
make setup               # Initialize project

# Code Quality
make lint                # Check code quality
make format              # Auto-format code
make ci                  # Run all CI checks locally

# Testing
make test-unit           # Fast unit tests
make test-integration    # Full integration tests
make test-all            # All tests
make coverage            # With coverage report

# Validation
make validate            # Validate all configs
make check-deps          # Check dependencies
make health              # Check service health
```

## 🔧 Breaking Changes

### Docker Socket Access

Scanners now use `docker-proxy` instead of direct socket access:

```yaml
# Old (insecure)
volumes:
  - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

# New (secure)
environment:
  DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker-proxy:2375
```

**Migration**: No action needed if using `make up`. The docker-proxy service starts automatically.

### Image Versions

Docker images now use pinned versions:

```yaml
# Before
image: tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:latest

# After  
image: tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:0.1.2
```

Custom images now tagged with VERSION:
```yaml
image: test-hard/openscap-scanner:${VERSION:-latest}
```

### Environment Variables

New variables in `.env.example`:

```bash
# Prometheus retention
PROMETHEUS_RETENTION_TIME=30d
PROMETHEUS_RETENTION_SIZE=10GB

# Atomic Red Team
ATOMIC_DRY_RUN=true
ATOMIC_TIMEOUT=60
```

**Migration**: Run `make setup` to update your `.env` file.
